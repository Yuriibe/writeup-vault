## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2 ‚Äì DLL Search Order Hijacking via `explorer.exe`

After messing around with in-memory payloads hidden in images (LSB), I wanted to try something more native like getting code to run just by dropping a DLL. So I started looking into **DLL search order hijacking**, and `explorer.exe` turned out to be a solid target.

### üéØ Goal

Inject a custom DLL that gets loaded by `explorer.exe` at startup, without any UAC prompt, and without using any EXE dropper or direct process injection.

---

#### üîç Step 1: Find a Missing DLL

Using **Procmon**, I filtered for:

`Process Name is explorer.exe`
`Result is NAME NOT FOUND`

I was looking for DLLs that Windows tries (and fails) to load, especially from:

- `C:\Windows\`
  
- `C:\Windows\System32\`

- The working directory of the process

This revealed several missing DLLs,

But I couldn‚Äôt find a consistently missing DLL that actually worked when hijacked most of them either existed or didn‚Äôt get loaded even if I dropped a fake one.

So I took a step back and did some research. That‚Äôs when I came across **`cscapi.dll`** a DLL that‚Äôs often referenced in hijacking examples. It turns out:

- It was historically used for **Offline Files (Client Side Caching)**, a feature that‚Äôs either disabled or not used on most systems today.

- Most importantly: even if it‚Äôs missing, **Windows and explorer.exe don‚Äôt care** they try to load it, fail silently, and move on.


So it‚Äôs a perfect candidate. I didn‚Äôt need to overwrite an active system file, and I knew `explorer.exe` would try to load it automatically ‚Äî which makes it great for a DLL hijack.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Create the Hijack DLL

A basic C-style DLL with `DllMain` was enough to verify execution:

```C
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved) {
    if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
        MessageBoxA(NULL, "DLL Loaded!", "Hijack", MB_OK);
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Compiled as a 64-bit DLL (since `explorer.exe` is x64), named it `cscapi.dll`.

---

#### üö® 3. Replace or Drop into System32

Because `explorer.exe` only looks in `System32`, I needed to place my DLL **directly into**:

`C:\Windows\System32\cscapi.dll`

To do that:

- **Took ownership** with `takeown /f`

- **Granted full permissions** with `icacls`

- **Move the old DLL or rename it **

- **Move our own DLL** into the System32 folder
  
We now have our original DLL as backup as well as our own malicous one

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è 4. Restart `explorer.exe`

With the hijack in place, I ran:

`taskkill /f /im explorer.exe`
` start explorer.exe``

And boom üí• the messagebox popped. The DLL was successfully hijacked and executed **as part of a trusted Windows process**.

### ‚úÖ Why This Works

- `explorer.exe` tries to load `cscapi.dll` (missing)

- Windows falls back to the search order (current dir ‚Üí system dirs)

- Our malicious DLL is right where it's looking

- No UAC prompt, no EXE  just native DLL loading

### üëÄ Coming Up in Part 3‚Ä¶

So far we‚Äôve done:

- ‚úÖ Stealthy payload delivery via image LSBs (Part 1)

- ‚úÖ Native execution via DLL hijacking (Part 2)


**Next up:**  
What happens when we _combine_ them?

In **Part 3**, I‚Äôll chain the steganographic image loader from Part 1 with the DLL hijack from Part 2 ‚Äî meaning:

- An image hides the payload

- The payload gets extracted and executed

- All triggered natively via something like `explorer.exe` without touching EXEs or triggering UAC
